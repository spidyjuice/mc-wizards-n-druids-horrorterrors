##Instructions

to install the mods, there are two things you have to do.

First, install forge on your client.
https://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/1.12.2-14.23.5.2854/forge-1.12.2-14.23.5.2854-installer.jar

Then, download windows-installer.bat (if you're on windows) or unix-installer.sh (if you're on mac/linux) from this git repository, drag it to your .minecraft directory, and run it. It will download all the mods and config files.

And you're done!
